# weather-app

This is a weather app which retrieves the current weather data for a certain city, more specific: the state of the weather, the current temperature and the min and max ones.
The data is retrieved from an OpenWeather API -> https://openweathermap.org/current through a backend built with NodeJS. 
The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
